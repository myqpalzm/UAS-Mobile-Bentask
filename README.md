Bentask is an Android aplication that helps its users organize their activities to be more structured and efficient. Bentask has several features besides the to-do list, like task categories, notifications, task update, task delete, and search filter.

### How to use

1. Before making a new task, first make a new category by tapping the round button with a plus sign at the bottom right of the screen and give the new category a name.
2. After the category is created, you can swipe the category button to the left or right to give you the option to update the category's name or delete it. Note that deleting the category also deletes all tasks inside the category.
3. To create a new task inside of the newly created category, tap on the category button.
4. Create a new task inside the category by tapping the round button at the bottom right of the screen, similar to making a new category.
5. In this page, you can fill in the input for task name, task description, date, and time. After that, tap the Done button.
6. You will be redirected to the selected category's page, and you can also see the newly created task. Swiping the task button to the left or right also gives you the option to update the task details or delete it.
7. If the task deadline is up, a notification will appear on your phone to notify you of the task.
8. To find a specific task on a task category, open the desired category and tap on the searc button. An input box will appear for you to search for a specific keyword that appears in all your tasks' names.
